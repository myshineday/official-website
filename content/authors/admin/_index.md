ShineDay is a simple and very easy-to-use habit tracking app. Just build your habit list, and assign each habit to the days of the week.

Habits scheduled for today will be displayed on the homepage. Just tap a habit to mark it finished and the habit icon will be colored to show that.

Habits will be clearly distributed among different time sections of a day so you can find them easily.

Other Features Include:

* Today Widget. You can directly check-in a habit on the widget without launching the main app.

* Several font types available.

* Support repeating habits.

Hope you guys like it, can't wait to see a better you!
